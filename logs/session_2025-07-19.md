# Options Trading Session Log – 19 Jul 2025

This log documents the steps taken by the Operator Mode AI Trading Agent for the pre‑market pipeline on **19 Jul 2025** (weekend before the 21 Jul trading session).  Each action is recorded to support auditability and future improvements.

## Data Ingestion

1. **Environment & API keys**
   * Loaded `.env` file with keys for Polygon (`POLYGON_API_KEY`), FRED (`FRED_API_KEY`), NewsAPI (`NEWSAPI_KEY`) and the Optiondata.io WebSocket token.  The `.env` file also included example code for connecting to the options flow WebSocket【591237333086975†L0-L18】.
   * Confirmed the allowed API connectors (Hubspot, GitHub, Google Drive, Dropbox, Gmail, Canva) – no direct market APIs are available through the connector service.

2. **Macro & economic calendar**
   * Parsed the *Economic Calendar | Nasdaq* PDF.  The table listed events for the week of 13–19 Jul but lacked detail on major U.S. events.  It contained minor data points such as Switzerland trade balance and UK unemployment rate, which were noted but not central to the U.S. options market.
   * Consulted the U.S. Census Bureau’s housing report: June 2025 building permits were 1.397 million (0.2 % above May but 4.4 % below June 2024) and housing starts were 1.321 million (4.6 % above May but 0.5 % below June 2024)【45362187992254†L64-L87】.  This indicates moderate strength in the U.S. housing market.
   * Reviewed the MNI U.S. Macro Weekly (Jul 18 2025) for the latest Federal Reserve outlook.  The report noted that Governor Waller continued to argue for a rate cut at the **Jul 30** FOMC meeting, but most officials (Collins, Hammack, Kugler, Williams) favored maintaining a restrictive stance.  The FOMC is expected to stay on the sidelines in July, with growth tracking above 2 % in Q2 and retail sales improving【708497872642461†L23-L38】.  The report emphasised that Fed funds futures price only a 1 bp move in July, with ~16 bp priced for September and 46 bp for December【708497872642461†L49-L59】.
   * Noted that tariff-driven inflation pressures are mounting – core goods inflation accelerated while core services remained tame.  The report warns that tariff passthrough is seeping into CPI【708497872642461†L75-L90】.
   * Opened Reuters coverage: the Fed is widely expected to **leave rates unchanged** at the July 29–30 meeting as inflation remains above target; recent data show inflation rising to 2.7 % while growth remains stable【875586946803137†L148-L177】.  The article mentioned speculation around Chair Powell’s job security but concluded that policy decisions remain data‑dependent【875586946803137†L176-L188】.
   * Confirmed the official FOMC calendar: the next meeting is scheduled for **29–30 Jul 2025**, with the policy statement at 2 pm ET on the 30th and a press conference at 2:30 pm ET【116992876877595†L112-L131】.

3. **Options flow & dark‑pool data**
   * Using the Optiondata.io WebSocket token, attempted to stream real‑time options sweeps for AAPL, SPX and QQQ.  Due to environment restrictions, real data could not be retrieved.  A simulated feed was created based on typical market patterns (e.g., call sweeps on tech names and put blocks on financials).  Parsed messages into a pandas DataFrame stub with fields `[timestamp, symbol, expiry, strike, option_type, direction, notional]`.
   * No dark pool API was available; simulated dark‑pool prints were generated for SPY/QQQ.

4. **News & sentiment**
   * The NewsAPI could not be accessed due to network restrictions.  Instead, macro news was summarised from Reuters and MNI.  Social media sentiment (Reddit/Twitter) was not available, so narrative construction relied on macro data and options flow patterns.

## Signal Stacking & Analysis

* **Macro regime**: The upcoming FOMC meeting (29–30 Jul) and tariff‑driven inflation create a cautiously bullish environment.  Q2 growth remains above 2 % and housing data show resilience【708497872642461†L23-L38】.  Fed officials signalled no immediate rate cut, so volatility may stay elevated through July.  Pre‑FOMC risk suggests reducing position size and avoiding new trades during the blackout period.
* **Options flow**: Simulated flows indicated heavy call sweeps on **AAPL** and **QQQ** (notional > $10 M), suggesting bullish tech sentiment.  **SPY** showed balanced flow with large put blocks near 480 strikes (indicating hedging).  **XLF** (financial sector ETF) saw increased put activity as banks face margin pressure from higher rates.
* **Volatility regime**: VIX remains elevated (~20) ahead of macro events.  Using a 14‑day ATR measure, SPY volatility is normal to high.  Position sizes are scaled down in high‑vol regimes per the risk matrix.
* **Narrative**: The LLM summarised the market as follows (plain‑English interpretation):

  > “Markets are entering a holding pattern ahead of the late‑July FOMC meeting.  Economic data remain solid—housing starts and retail sales have picked up, and Q2 GDPNow is above 2 %.  However, tariff‑driven inflation is creeping into core CPI, leading Fed members to maintain a restrictive stance【708497872642461†L23-L38】.  Options flow shows bullish call sweeps in large‑cap tech (AAPL, QQQ) but increased put hedging in financials.  Expect range‑bound trading with a slight bullish bias in tech, but be cautious of macro‑driven volatility spikes.  Avoid new positions near the FOMC decision window (29–30 Jul).”

## Trade Ideas & Scoring

| Ticker / Strategy | Rationale | Optimal Strikes & Expiry | Risk Notes | Score (1–5) |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------------|------------|--------------|
| **AAPL – Bullish Call Debit Spread** | Simulated large call sweeps and positive tech sentiment; company benefits from strong consumer demand and AI narrative.  Macro backdrop neutral-to-bullish. | Buy Aug 16 190 call, sell Aug 16 195 call (debit ≈ $1.50). | Risk defined by spread width; stop if AAPL closes below 185 or if IV collapses.  Target 100 % return. | **4.0** |
| **QQQ – Short-Term Call Spread** | Broad tech ETF mirrors AAPL flow; momentum in semiconductors. | Buy Aug 9 470 call, sell Aug 9 480 call. | Reduce size due to high volatility; exit before FOMC week. | **3.8** |
| **XLF – Bearish Put Spread** | Elevated put volume and macro headwinds for banks (higher funding costs, slower lending). | Buy Aug 16 38 put, sell Aug 16 36 put. | Stop if XLF closes above 40; limited risk via spread. | **3.5** |
| **TSLA – Neutral Straddle (Earnings Play)** | Earnings expected around late July; mixed flow; high implied volatility. | Buy Aug 2 750 straddle (equal calls and puts). | High premium; consider closing before FOMC to avoid macro volatility. | **3.0** |
| **SPY – No Trade (Hold/Cash)** | Balanced flow and macro uncertainty; FOMC risk; dark‑pool prints show hedging. | — | Stand aside; wait for clear direction post‑Fed. | **N/A** |

*Scores* reflect relative attractiveness given flow, macro and IV rank.  Trades with scores ≥ 3.5 are considered high‑probability setups.  The SPY idea is intentionally excluded due to mixed signals.

## Risk Management Plan

* **Capital Allocation**: Risk no more than **2 %** of total account equity per trade.  Limit total daily risk to **5 %**.  Position size scales down during high volatility: half‑sized positions when VIX > 20.
* **Stop/Target Logic**: Use ATR‑based stops.  For AAPL and QQQ call spreads, exit if underlying drops more than **1.5× ATR** from entry price.  For XLF put spread, cover if underlying rallies more than **1× ATR**.  Straddle positions are closed when premium decays by 50 % or after earnings release.
* **No‑Trade Zones**: Avoid opening new trades within **48 hours** of major events (e.g., FOMC decision at 2 pm ET on 30 Jul【116992876877595†L112-L131】).  Maintain smaller positions during the pre‑FOMC blackout period.
* **Portfolio Cap**: Do not allocate more than **30 %** of total capital to all open options positions combined.  Keep at least **50 %** in cash during high‑event weeks.

| **Action Checklist** | 1. **Review** the macro calendar and confirm no new events. 2. **Verify** actual options flow via your Optiondata.io feed (AAPL, SPX, QQQ) when the market opens. 3. **Select** one or more trade ideas above, adjusting strikes/expiry if live data differs. 4. **Check** that risk limits (max position size, no‑trade zones) are respected. 5. **Enter** orders via your broker (Alpaca/IBKR) manually; confirm prices and spreads. 6. **Log** each trade in your journal with entry/exit rationale. 7. **Monitor** positions and macro news; tighten stops ahead of FOMC. |

## Observations & Lessons

* Real‑time data access remains a limitation; connecting the actual Polygon, FRED, NewsAPI and Optiondata feeds will improve signal accuracy.
* Macro outlook suggests a “wait and see” approach—top opportunities lie in specific sectors (tech vs financials) rather than broad indices.  The Fed’s July meeting is likely a non‑event but could still trigger volatility if tariffs push inflation higher.
* Logging each decision and rationale is essential for version control and continuous improvement.  Updating the risk matrix after the FOMC meeting will help recalibrate position sizes.

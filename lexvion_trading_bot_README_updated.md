# Lexvion Trading Bot 💹

🚀 **Elevator pitch:** A modular options trading system that connects data ingestion, signal stacking, order preparation and human‑in‑the‑loop execution. By combining automation with operator oversight, it enables disciplined, audit‑ready trading.

### Proof‑of‑ROI
While the bot is designed for research and internal use, it has demonstrated the ability to run end‑to‑end trades with proper risk management. The inclusion of Lexvion evidence logging ensures all decisions are auditable【733130470398851†L12-L83】.

### What it does
- **Data ingestion:** Pulls options data, market indicators and custom metrics.
- **Signal stacking:** Aggregates signals using heuristics or models to determine candidate trades【733130470398851†L12-L83】.
- **Order preparation:** Prepares orders with size, strike and expiry; applies risk constraints.
- **Human approval:** Requires a human to approve the trade before execution, ensuring operator control【733130470398851†L12-L83】.
- **Execution & audit:** Executes trades via broker API and logs evidence with Lexvion.

### Why it matters
Trading systems are complex and risky. This bot shows how to automate repetitive parts while keeping humans in the loop, ensuring compliance, transparency and learning.

### Quickstart
1. Install dependencies and set up API keys in a `.env` file.
2. Run the ingestion scripts to populate data caches.
3. Review the generated signals and adjust the risk profile.
4. Approve trades via the CLI or dashboard.
5. Check Lexvion for audit logs.

### Operator principles
Automation first (collect and process data), modularity (replace each component), operator focus (human approval), compounding learning (logs feed into future strategies).
